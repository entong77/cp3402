Week 4 Learning Journal

Learning Activities & Resources:
This week, the primary task was to install WordPress on our device. During the installation, I encountered some challenges. 
Notably, after installation, I was unable to log in due to errors like "cannot connect to database" or "invalid database name." 
Initially, my attempts to troubleshoot were unsuccessful. However, I managed to find solutions by searching for these specific 
error messages on YouTube. The following videos were particularly helpful: How to Install WordPress for installation guidance 
and Troubleshooting SQL Connection Issues for resolving database connection problems. Eventually, I successfully logged in and started using WordPress.

Estimated Hours:
This week's activities took approximately 2 hours, as most of the process was efficiently completed during class.

Content Insights:
A key learning from this week is the process of installing WordPress on a personal device. This skill is vital, especially when
you need to use WordPress on a new computer. Understanding the installation and troubleshooting process is crucial for smooth operation.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
WordPress is an immensely useful tool for website creation. I believe it will be an invaluable asset in my future career. Furthermore, 
if I ever open my own guitar studio, I now have the skills to design the website independently, which is a significant advantage.
