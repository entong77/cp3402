This week, I practiced changing background colors, text colors, and adjusting spacing and line spacing. 
These tasks enhanced my understanding of the visual aspects of document design. I learned that background 
color significantly affects the readability and mood of a document. Choosing a subtle color that doesn't 
overpower the text was key. Similarly, changing the text color to red highlighted important information, 
but I had to ensure it didn't clash with the background. Adjusting line spacing and paragraph spacing was 
crucial for readability. Too little space made the text cramped, while too much made it disjointed. This 
exercise was a valuable lesson in the importance of design elements in document presentation.
