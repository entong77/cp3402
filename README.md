Overview
Today, I focused on developing a basic website for my startup, "Visionary PCs". The site consists of three main sections: the homepage (index.html), About Us (about.html), and Contact Us (contact.html). I also crafted a CSS style file (style.css) to unify the look and feel of the site.

Tasks Accomplished
Homepage (index.html)

Designed a welcoming banner and a basic introduction to the company.
Ensured the navigation bar links to other parts of the site.
About Us (about.html)

Added detailed information about the company, our team, and our vision.
Included images depicting our services and products.
Contact Us (contact.html)

Created a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
Provided the companyâ€™s address and other contact details.
Styling (style.css)

Chose a harmonious color scheme (blue tones and light orange) with black text for readability.
Implemented responsive design for a good display across different devices.

Conclusion
Today's work was a tremendous learning experience for me. I not only improved my front-end development skills but also gained a deeper understanding of how to design a user-friendly and visually appealing website. I look forward to continuing to develop this project and making it a showcase I can be proud of.
