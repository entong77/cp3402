CP3402 Week 8 Learning Journal

Learning Activities & Resources
This week's main focus is on applying the scientific method to a theory and conducting a test

Choose a specific CMS or PHP topic for the experiment.
In the first phase, rely on traditional learning methods such as reading documentation and watching tutorials.
In the second phase, engage in interactive coding exercises related to the chosen topic.
Document the time spent, engagement level, and understanding in each phase.
Analyze and compare the outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness of each method.
Estimated Hours
I anticipate spending about 5 hours on this, considering the need to balance Assignment 2 and the learning journal, 
which involves researching, comparing, and summarizing learning methods.

Content Insights
The experiment revealed a significant improvement in my understanding and retention when I included interactive 
coding exercises. These hands-on practices deepened my comprehension of the topics, and the active involvement kept 
me consistently engaged. The experiment underscores the value of interactive and practical learning, particularly in 
technical fields like CMS and PHP. I plan to incorporate more coding exercises into my study routine for a more enriching 
and efficient learning experience.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This learning experiment offered valuable insights into how career development, employability, and effective learning 
strategies intersect. It confirmed the importance of practical skills in CMS and PHP, contributing greatly to my technical prowess. 
Such hands-on skills not only enhance employability but also demonstrate the ability to apply knowledge in real-world situations, 
a highly desirable trait in the tech sector. The experiment emphasized the need for a balanced learning approach, blending theoretical 
knowledge with interactive activities, crucial for ongoing professional growth. It also highlighted the importance of adaptability, 
technological flexibility, and self-motivation for continuous career advancement. Going forward, I will focus on integrating interactive 
and practical learning methods, ensuring I stay competitive in the ever-evolving tech and content management landscape.
